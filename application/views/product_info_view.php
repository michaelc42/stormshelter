		<h4>The only in-home shelter reinforced with DuPont™ KEVLAR®</h4>
		<p class="grid_11 alpha">
			Being prepared for severe weather conditions goes beyond buying batteries and stocking up on bottled 
			water during storm season. It starts right within the home. During a hurricane or tornado, windborne debris
			ranging from broken building materials to common household items can become dangerous flying missiles. 
			Unfortunately, masonry, framing and sheet rock alone are not designed to stop this kind of threat. If a tornado 
			suddenly appears on the horizon, or a hurricane lands close to home, it is critical that families have a 
			secure shelter. 
			<br />
			<br />
			The DuPont™ StormRoom™ with KEVLAR® is an invaluable, easy addition to an existing home, or an important element 
			in new building designs. Families feel protected in their own home and builders feel confident that their houses offer 
			reliable storm protection. Houses can be rebuilt, but families are irreplaceable.
