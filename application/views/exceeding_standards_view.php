			Coastal regions are becoming more populated every year. Many of these areas become dangerous during severe weather, with
			 the threats of strong winds and extreme conditions. Many states, such as Florida, encourage residents to have a room in
			  their home built to withstand the windborne debris of a storm. The  DuPont™ StormRoom™ with KEVLAR® has the strength
			   to endure the dangers of severe weather.
			<br />
			<br />
			Only DuPont™ StormRoom™ with Kevlar® comes with the advantage of the DuPont 200-year history of science and safety
			 behind it, and has the strength to endure the dangers of severe hurricanes and tornados. Engineered and designed by
			  DuPont scientists, the DuPont™ StormRoom™ meets FEMA requirements for Cat 5 hurricane and F5 tornado shelters .
			<br />
			<br />
			DuPont™ StormRoom™ with Kevlar® has been tested at the Wind Science & Engineering Research Center at Texas Tech 
			University and meets FEMA storm shelter requirements for Category 5 hurricane and F5 tornado shelters.  National 
			standards set by FEMA require a storm shelter withstand the impact from a 15-pound two-by-four moving at 100 mph 
			(speed that a 250 mph wind would carry a building timber).  The entire DuPont™ StormRoom™, including the door, 
			withstood repeated hits by the same size two-by-four fired at windborne debris speeds greater than those seen in 
			Category 5 storms.
			<br />
			<br />
			Recently, the International Code Council (ICC) developed a new building code for storm shelters called ICC-500. 
			 Many of the testing requirements found in the FEMA 320 guidelines are also found in the new ICC- 500 certification for 
			 storm shelters.  DuPont™ StormRoom™ meets all of these proposed ICC requirements, and once the ICC – 500 is published 
			 DuPont will seek to obtain certification for an ICC-500 storm shelter.
